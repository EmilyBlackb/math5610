# Vector 1-Norm

**Routine Name:**           onenormv

**Author:** Emily Blackburn

**Language:** C++. The code can be compiled using the g++ compiler.


**Description/Purpose:** This routine will compute the 1-norm of an arbitrary vector will real number entries. 

**Input:** This routine takes a vector (a 1 by n or n by 1 matrix created using the matrix struct) as input. Matrices of other dimensions will return an error message.

**Output:** This routine returns the 1-norm of the vector input as a real number.

**Usage/Example:**

The routine has one argument needed to return the 1-norm value.

    Matrix v(5,1), w(2,2);
    rfillm(v);
    rfillm(w);
    double result = onenormv(v);
    cout << result << endl;
    result = onenormv(w);

Output from the lines above:

      3.72776
      Error: the vector needs to have either 1 column or 1 row

The the first output is the calculated 1-norm of the vector v. The second output is an error message generated by trying to use 2 by 2 matrix as input in the function.

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for onenormv()

      #include "matrixstruct.hpp"

      double onenormv(Matrix v){
          double sum = 0, absvalue = 0;
          if(v.columns == 1){
              for(int i = 0; i < v.rows; i++){
                  absvalue = v.matrix[i][0];
                  if (absvalue < 0) absvalue = -1.0*absvalue; //This turns negative numbers to positive numbers
                  sum = sum + absvalue;
              }
          }
          else if(v.rows == 1){
              for(int i = 0; i < v.columns; i++){
                  absvalue = v.matrix[0][i];
                  if (absvalue < 0) absvalue = -1.0*absvalue; //This turns negative numbers to positive numbers
                  sum = sum + absvalue;
              }
          }
          else cout << "Error: the vector needs to have either 1 column or 1 row" << endl;
          return sum;
      }
