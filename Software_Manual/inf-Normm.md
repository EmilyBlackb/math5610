# Matrix Infinity-Norm

**Routine Name:**           infnormm

**Author:** Emily Blackburn

**Language:** C++. The code can be compiled using the g++ compiler.


**Description/Purpose:** This routine will compute  the âˆž-norm of a given square matrix (also known as the max norm).

**Input:** This routine takes a square matrix (rows = columns) using the matrix struct as input. Matrices of other dimensions will return an error message.

**Output:** This routine returns the matrix infinity-norm as a double.

**Usage/Example:**

The routine has one argument needed to return the 1-norm value.



Output from the lines above:


The output is the matrix infinity norm of matrix 

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for onenormv()
