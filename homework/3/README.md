### Homework 3 Tasks:

1. [ ] [Task:](1-2normabserr.md)
 Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 2-norm is used. Make sure to add an entry to your software manual to document the work.
2. [ ] [Task:](2-1normabserr.md)
 Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the 1-norm is used. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
3. [ ] [Task:](3-infnormabserr.md)
 Implement a method that returns the absolute error in the approximation of one vector by another when the ∞
-norm is used. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method. 
4. [ ] [Task:](4-1matrixnorm.md)
 Implement a method that returns the 1-matrix norm of a given square matrix. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method. 
5. [ ] [Task:](5-infmatrixnorm.md)
 Implement a method that returns the ∞-norm of a given square matrix. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
6. [ ] [Task:](6-2Norm.md)
 Implement a method that returns the dot produce of two vectors of the same length. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
7. [ ] [Task:](7-1Norm.md)
 Implement a method that returns the cross-product of two vectors of length three. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
8. [ ] [Task:](8-InfinityNorm.md)
 Implement a method that returns the product of two matrices with an equal inner dimension. Add an entry to your software manual that documents the method.
9. [ ] [Task:](9-SymmetricMatrix.md)
 Write a routine that will generate a diagonally dominant matrix that has real values in all entries of the matrix. Add an entry to your for the method you create.
10. [ ] [Task:](10-MatrixNormDiscussion.md)
 Search the internet for sites that define and discuss the Frobenius matrix norm. Also, look for sites that define consistent matrix norms. Summarize in a paragraph or two what you found and as usual cite the sites.
