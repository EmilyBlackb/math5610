# Online Linear Algebra Packages

Task: Search the internet for sites that discuss linear algebra packages for solving linear algebra problems. Find a couple of sites that most closely line up with what you think we will be doing in the class. Reference the sites in a brief discussion. 


### Armadillo
Armadillo is a C++ library for linear algebra & scientific computing:

<http://arma.sourceforge.net/>

Armadillo has similar structure to matlab and has efficient structs for matrics, cubes, and vectors. Supports sparse and dense matrices. Various matrix decompositions provided through LAPACK.

### Elemental

Elemental is open-source, openly-developed, software for distributed-memory dense and sparse-direct linear algebra and optimization which supports a wide range of functionality not available elsewhere:

### LAPACK++

LAPACK++ (Linear Algebra PACKage in C++) is a software library for numerical linear algebra that solves systems of linear equations and eigenvalue problems on high performance computer architectures.

<https://math.nist.gov/lapack++/>

LAPACK++ supports banded, triangular, tridiagonal, symmetric, and non-symmetric matrices as well as symmetric positive definite systems. 

### Eigen

Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
