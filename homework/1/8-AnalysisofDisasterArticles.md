## The Patriot Missile Failure

In 1991 an American Patriot Missile battery failed to detect an incoming Iraqi Scud missile resulting in the death of 28 soldiers and several injuries. The American Patriot Missile battery failed to detect the Scud missle due to a calculation error in the code that was propagated and intensified as the the Missile battery ran over long periods of time. The error was due to the conversion from converting the time to a binary code. Since the code converted the 1/10 of a second to a 24-bit binary, the tail end was cut off resulting in 100 hours a 0.34 second error. The longer the Missile battery ran, the larger the error was. Some of the code had been improved, however, this resulted in more error since this meant that the errors generated did not cancel each other.
